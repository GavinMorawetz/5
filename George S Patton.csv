Men, this stuff that some sources sling around about
America wanting out of this war, not wanting to fight,
is a crock of bullshit. Americans love to fight,
traditionally. All real Americans love the sting and
clash of battle. You are here today for three reasons.
First, because you are here to defend your homes and
your loved ones. Second, you are here for your own
self respect, because you would not want to be
anywhere else. Third, you are here because you are
real men and all real men like to fight. When you,
here, everyone of you, were kids, you all admired the
champion marble player, the fastest runner, the
toughest boxer, the big league ball players, and the
All-American football players. Americans love a
winner. Americans will not tolerate a loser. Americans
despise cowards. Americans play to win all of the time.
I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed. That's why Americans have
never lost nor will ever lose a war; for the very idea of losing is hateful to an American.
You are not all going to die, only two percent of you right here today would die in a
major battle. Death must not be feared. Death, in time, comes to all men. Yes, every
man is scared in his first battle. If he says he's not, he's a liar. Some men are cowards
but they fight the same as the brave men or they get the hell slammed out of them
watching men fight who are just as scared as they are. The real hero is the man who
fights even though he is scared. Some men get over their fright in a minute under fire.
For some, it takes an hour. For some, it takes days. But a real man will never let his fear
of death overpower his honor, his sense of duty to his country, and his innate manhood.
Battle is the most magnificent competition in which a human being can indulge. It brings
out all that is best and it removes all that is base. Americans pride themselves on being
He Men and they ARE He Men. Remember that the enemy is just as frightened as you
are, and probably more so. They are not supermen.
